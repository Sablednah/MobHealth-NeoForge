# Normally run for you by .github/workflows/modrinth.yml when a GitHub release is published, so
# publishing to GitHub publishes to Modrinth as well as CurseForge. Runnable by hand for a re-upload.
#
# Unlike CurseForge, Modrinth takes game versions by NAME, so no numeric ID lookup is needed. What it
# does take that CurseForge will not is a LIST of them on one file, which is the whole reason this
# script bothers with ranges: the 26.1 jar declares [26.1,26.2), so it should appear for someone
# filtering 26.1 or 26.1.1, not only for the 26.1.2 it happened to be built against.
#
# Optional environment:
#   MODRINTH_VERSION_RANGE   Maven-style range, e.g. "[26.1,26.2)" — expanded against the versions
#                            Modrinth actually lists. The workflow reads this from the branch that
#                            built the jar.
#   MODRINTH_GAME_VERSIONS   Explicit comma-separated list; overrides the range entirely.
#   MODRINTH_DEBUG           Print the metadata (contains no credentials).
